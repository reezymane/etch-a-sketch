# etch-a-sketch

Welcome to your browser Etch-A-Sketch! The purpose of this project was to demostrate new DOM skills and to practice researching new methods to bring it to life.
I used javascript to create divs in html, used css for styling, created functions to run the program, and was introduced to CSS Grid.
